 *
 * In this Priority Queue implementation, the internal ordering of elements
 * of equal priority is arbitrary. In other words, elements inserted with
 * equal priority are not necessarily removed in FIFO order. We only need
 * to guarantee that the highest priority elements are removed before lower
 * priority elements.
